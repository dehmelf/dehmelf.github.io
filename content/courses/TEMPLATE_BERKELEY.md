## Directory Structure for Teaching Materials

Create folders in `/static/teaching/` like this:
```
/static/teaching/
├── cs70/
│   ├── lecture1.pdf
│   ├── lecture2.pdf
│   └── tutorial1.pdf
├── cs61b/
│   ├── exam1.pdf
│   └── solutions1.pdf
└── math55/
    └── exam.pdf
```

Then link to them as: `/teaching/course_name/filename.pdf`
